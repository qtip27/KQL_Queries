## KQL Query Repository
Welcome to the KQL Query Repository! This repository contains a curated collection of KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries tailored for insightful analysis and monitoring within Azure environments.

## Introduction
KQL, also known as Kusto Query Language, is a powerful query language used in Azure services such as Azure Data Explorer, Azure Monitor, and Azure Sentinel. It allows users to interactively query, analyze, and visualize large datasets with high performance and scalability.
