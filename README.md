KQL Query Repository
Welcome to the KQL Query Repository! This repository contains a curated collection of KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries tailored for insightful analysis and monitoring within Azure environments.

Introduction
KQL, also known as Kusto Query Language, is a powerful query language used in Azure services such as Azure Data Explorer, Azure Monitor, and Azure Sentinel. It allows users to interactively query, analyze, and visualize large datasets with high performance and scalability.

This repository aims to provide a centralized resource for KQL queries, covering a wide range of scenarios including:

Monitoring Azure resources
Analyzing logs and metrics
Detecting anomalies and security threats
Optimizing resource utilization
